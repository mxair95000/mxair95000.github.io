<p>Wanrong(Malibasi, 萬榮鄉) is a rural township which is located southeast of Hualien, Taiwan. With a population of about 6,500～ 7,000,  93.12% of residents are Malibasi people. Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) introduced the DRTS (Demand Responsive Transit System) at the end of 2017, hoping to solve the commuting needs. However, according to the report, the usage rate is quite a law, was less than 20 People Per Month, which shows DRTS doesn’t meet residents’ needs. To understand the problems faced by DRTS, the team took a four-day field survey in Wanrong to design a new transportation service.</p>

<p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the problems faced by DRTS in the local context, we conduct field research to understand local needs and design solutions.During the four days of study, we interviewed 32 local people, including Civil servants, students and older people, among six different villages and tribes.</p>
<p>We found that residents Seldom use public transit because of the poor on-time performance and limited routes. With the budget shortage, MOTC’s DRTS  can’t be “Demand Responsive”, and hard to meet different users’ needs. Most local people never use the DRTS. Older Adults with Chronic ill have to spend lots of money on TAXI for monthly follow-up appointments. Because the bus stop is far from the tribe, only the taxi can offer door-to-door transportation.</p>

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the problems faced by DRTS in the local context, we used the design thinking approach as the main axis, together with actual field surveys to understand local needs and design solutions.

During the four days of field study, we interviewed 32 local people, including Civil servants, students and older people, across six different villages and tribes.

We found that residents Seldom use public transportation because of the poor on-time performance and limited routes. With the budget shortage, MOTC's DRTS  can't be "Demand Responsive", and hard to meet different users' needs. Most local people never use the DRTS. Older Adults with Chronic Diseases have to spend lots of money on TAXI for monthly follow-up appointments. Because the bus stop is far from the tribe, only the taxi can offer door-to-door transportation.


#### People
Like many rural area, Due to lack of job opportunities, local adults often work in the city, the kids and older adults live together in tribe.

#### Job and Opportunity
Indigenous peoplee's retirement earlier than other Han People for 10 Year（55 Years-Old）. Many people do seasonal jobs such as grass cutting and harvesting to supplement their families

#### Transportion
Overall, public transpiration is insufficient in Warong. Local people compline on limit of the route of bus and train.  And Due to the limited budget,  MOTC's DRTS can only serves as is fixed-route shuttle bus, 4 days a week, can't meets local people's  commuting needs, loosing the purpose of "Demand Responsive"


#### Students
Most Students who above junior high school live in dormitory because of the inconvenient transportation


#### Village
Transporttaion problem is different depends on their village,  Residents of flatland villages (e.g. Man Wing Village) will use cabs to go to the city for medical treatment, while residents of mountain villages (e.g. Chien Ching Village) may call ambulances directly to send them down the mountain. The village cab driver keeps a notebook with the dates of regular medical appointments for the elderly, and the village chief also cares about the tribe and remembers the needs of each resident, matching the elderly who need medical care with families who have a car to transport them.

<p>Due to the Sparsely populated environment and unreliable public transit, students have to wake up more early for school, and older adults need to spend more money to go to the hospital. On the other side, we found local area has a strong community relationship and a high ownership rate of cars and smartphones. It shows carpool has the potential to solve the transportation problem.</p>

We provide three personas to distinguish different commuters: Ali, the student; Jiru, the chronic disease patient and Bayan, the office worker. Every day Ali took the bus to school, but the bus was often not on time, so she had to get up early and have a long walk to the bus stop outside the tribe. To Jiru, the bus stop is too far for him, so he takes a Taxi from home to the hospital twice a month, but it also takes a lot of money. Bayan drives his car to the office in the urban area every day and looks for people to share the gas charge.

In that case, how could we match those three people to take the same car to their destination?


</br>
</br>



#### More Flexible Allowance Design
Exsiting DRTS service rely on govmments Allowance, mainly paring for the driver and veniqel, it took

- alllownce with identity

<!---
We provide there persona to distinguish different kinds of commuter: Ali the students, Jiru the chronic disease patient and Bayan the office worker.

Ali and Jiru do not have a car, and have to wait for several hours for a return bus to the hospital because of the low frequency of DRTS. Most of the school-going community asks their parents to take the bus to the city on the Taikoo Line, but the local bus is not on time and it is dangerous if the parents are not available for the return trip at night. We note that 10% of the idle population can retire early because of their indigenous status, and they earn money through seasonal work, making their lifestyle more flexible and capable of working. This is an opportunity to transport students and people who regularly go to the doctor.


We believe that (B) early retirees with cars and flexible schedules are a low-cost solution to the needs of (A) students and (B) regular medical caregivers, and that by replacing the original DRTS service with ridesharing, the problem of insufficient vehicles and manpower to operate daily can be solved. The GO APP allows greater freedom to match ridesharing than the original DRTS, which can only be used during work hours. We have decided to name this service "Co-Prosperity GO" to solve the needs of the local population.

## Legal Compliance: TAXI or Carpool ?


In 2018, Carpooling or UBER-like service is not legal in Taiwan yet, because govment think most Carpool service is not real Carpool, they more like Taxi without "Taxi Business Running Registration". In order to meet the definition of "Carpool", our service follow the Ministry of Transportation and Communication(MTOC) Notice 1075002889 , which means "Twice a day"

<p>To focus on commuting needs and meet the carpool regulations, users could only carpool twice a day, one for left and another one for return. Passengers have to order a carpool before 19:00. From 19:00 to 20:00 system will send carpool requests to the suitable riders, and the rider could choose to accept. At 21:00, everyone will know their matching result.</p>

Persona concludes there are kinds of users: Ali, the student; Jiru, a chronic disease older adult; and Bayan, the office worker. The residents like Bayan often ride downtown, where are the hospital and school located. So Bayan could be the carpool rider to pick up tribe residents like Jiru and Ali to the destination. Rider's gas fee could pay with MoTC's allowance for DRTS.

<p>In that case, everyone could get what they need,  and the government’s DRTS budget could be used more effectiveness</p>

We have named our newly designed carpool service "GonRonGo—共榮GO", which is a combination of the words "共乘（Carpooling）" and location name "萬榮"（WanRong）". The term "共榮" also means harmony and co-prosperity. It could represent our goal to meet the needs of local people, making the community grow and have a well-being life.

<p>On the day of departure, the app will display the task information of the day and remind the user to departure. The rider screen APP will show the boarding point of each ride-sharing passenger and the estimated time of arrival at the destination. If the passenger does not show up, the rider clicks the button to report the issue. Too many no-shows will make the account deactivated for seven days.</p>

<p>At the end of the internship period, our app “GonRonGo 共榮Go— Carpooling Service for the rural area”  won the Ministry of Economic Affairs’ 2018 DIGI+ Talent Award. We believe this pilot study could encourage government agencies to use carpool as a more flexible and affordable solution for rural areas transportation.</p>

<p>After six months of user research and design, we create GonRonGo（共榮GO） App, a carpool app match local people to get carpool. Still, To sovle problem in rural area, a app is far from enough.There are a lot of problem need to be solve. First, during the field research , we found there are many of address of rural area doesn’t include in the Google Map. which affects daily life and tourism development. Second, the exsiting laws of carpool are not flexible, which will making process of design new transportation service become slow. Third, serious rural depopulation affect local people’s life, lots of older adults can’t get enough care from family.To make a well-being community, we still need interdisciplinary expert to improve rural area continuily.</p>
